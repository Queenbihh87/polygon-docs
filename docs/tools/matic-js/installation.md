[Matic.js](https://github.com/maticnetwork/matic.js) a JavaScript library that facilitates interaction with the Polygon network. It provides developers with simplified operations such as depositing, transferring, and withdrawing assets; allowing them to focus on building dApps without the need for in-depth knowledge of blockchain systems. 

Matic.js supports two popular libraries:

1. [Web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/)
2. [Ethers](https://docs.ethers.io/)
